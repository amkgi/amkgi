### Hi! I'm Alexey Kashavkin. 🤝

I'm currently working as a system architect on NFV solutions, which allows me to dive deeper into Linux and learn more and more about it as I explore it and my capabilities. I'm also learning and writing in the C language. 🔍 

Also, take a look at my pins, maybe you will find something interesting for yourself there. 📋
