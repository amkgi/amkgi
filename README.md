### Hi! I'm Alexey Kashavkin. 🤝

I'm currently working as a C-developer on a Linux distribution development project. 👨🏻‍💻

Previously I worked as a system architect on NFV solutions, which allowed me to dive deeper into Linux and learn more and more about it, exploring it and my capabilities. 🔍 

Also, take a look at my pins, maybe you will find something interesting for yourself there. 📋
